# solenoid

## Overview

This is a VIK module created by [Aleblazer](https://github.com/Aleblazer) to add a solenoid to a controller. It requires 5V, GND, and the GPIO_AD1 VIK connection.

## Details

Please refer to the [VIK-solenoid repo](https://github.com/Aleblazer/VIK-Solenoid) for any necessary details.

Note that as of this writing, there is also a VIK xs (extra small) version in the [ExtraSmallVIK branch](https://github.com/Aleblazer/VIK-Solenoid/tree/ExtraSmallVIK)
